This is a technical front-end exam. <br/>

# Tasks 1 - 4
Clone repository and create launch pages retrieved from gql and use compostables whenever you use an action or methods.

Notes: I wasn't able to create a proper sorting for dates, because I didn't notice it until it was late. At first, I thought that whenever you fetch it is already sorted but, it is only sorted by its year but not of its actual launch date. I also want to include that I was not able to utilize the compostables very well because the work that I did didn't seem to need it so I prioritized doing the important tasks other than make it look cleaner. Now looking back at my work I do think that compostables could have helped a lot in developing and managing the functions that you have used because of the weird environment that Nuxt provides.

# Task 5 - 6
Create a dedicated rocket page and another page where you'll be able to see more details regarding the rocket that you have clicked from the previous page.

Notes: I think I did this pretty well but, because of my just studying Vue for a few days I'm still not sure if the methods that I used are the best in producing the page. I didn't use vuetify because learning it will take a lot of time and I wasn't comfortable yet in using Vue components so errors might occur when I use it. I did use components that are reusable but created most of my designs in tailwind.

# Bonus Tasks 
Add a favorite feature where users can favorite a rocket and be able to access it from a different page by using a centralized store Pinia.

Notes: I was able to do this because fortunately, I did a project that used redux which is similar and I didn't have to adjust as much as I did to be able to utilize Pinia.

## Details

Built from August 25 to August 28 <br/>
Limits:<br/>
I was only able to design this on a 16:9 1920:1080 resolution.<br/>
It might work on lower resolution but I'm not confident that it will, if I had more time the design of this in mobile would be similar to Twitter where the navigation bars are at the bottom and most of the body is on top of it. <br/>
Time spent on this project around 18 hrs provided by wakatime. <br/>
This is a great and fun exam that I did to learn and practice vue 3.0 and nuxt 3.0 <br/>
